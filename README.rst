Welcome to Hierarchical Matrices!
=================================

This package is the result of my master thesis at the `Institute of Mathematics, University of Zurich <http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?&L=1>`_

It provides an interface in python to the concept of hierarchical matrices as described by `W. Hackbusch <https://books.google.ch/books?id=LlNECwAAQBAJ>`_

The main goal is to provide an easy to use yet performing alternative to existing implementations in C
